# Getting directly to the point is okay
I was recently introduced to the [nohello](https://aka.ms/nohello) concept and I really liked it! Like everyone who spends a lot of time online for their job, I too had seen too many "Hi" messages left hanging in space.

If you haven't seen what I'm talking about, take a moment to go check out Sebastien's page or [nohello.com](http://www.nohello.com/). I'll wait.

So what's different for nosocial? Not much really. This page is to let colleagues know that when they reach out on chat that it's perfectly acceptable to **bypass social formalties** and just get to the point ask the question! No need to worry about saying any of the following:
<pre>
Hi..
How is everything going?
Are you busy?
</pre>
Chat isn't in-person or phone communication. By directing you to this page, you're being advised that getting directly to the point, for work related questions, is okay. No offense will be taken because you bypassed social etiquette on greeting.

Just be sensible about things and don't use this as an excuse to be a d*ck.

This is an amendment of [Sebastien's](https://github.com/sbmueller) copy of the original website nohello.com. Acknowledgements go to the original anonymous author. I'm Antipodean and we tend to like direct, no BS communication. I can appreciate this approach isn't for everyone. The opinion's expressed under nosocial are my own and not my employer. The source of this file is publicly available on github.com.
